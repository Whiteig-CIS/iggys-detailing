                text="My name is Isaac White, and detailing has been a passion of mine since I was young. I first started detailing in high school, where I quickly discovered how much I enjoyed bringing out the best in every vehicle and boat I worked on. Over the years, I’ve built on that foundation by dedicating myself to learning the best techniques, tools, and practices to deliver top-quality results for my clients. Today, while attending the University of South Carolina, I continue to grow my detailing business with the same commitment to precision and care that sparked my passion in the beginning. Every project I take on is more than just a job—it’s an opportunity to combine hard work and attention to detail to create a result that speaks for itself."
